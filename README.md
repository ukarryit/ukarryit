a game that profiles the cute little one celled organisms experience through life.  

Level 1 starts in deep space. Your character is travelling in a smooth manner through the blackness of space. The faster you go the faster you accumulate points. In the beginning of time you move at 60 beats/points per minute. If you go faster you will get to level two faster. The end of level one is the “Big Bang”. Your character will have to survive it. There are many different obstacles in space.
Level  two spits you out of the wormhole that puts you in a world of “moving rocks”. These rocks are coming at you at different speeds. You must avoid flying material. 

This game is like crypto kitties but with a meaning. It will be one of the safest transaction ledgers but an educational tool to our children as well. We must get our youth interested in computer science or we will move backwards as a society.

In the game you start as a one celled organism. The game allows you to create your avatar 1 of 15 ways, but you always start as a one celled organism.  This creates the cell replication concept of the game. The object of the game is to turn yourself into a human being by “connecting cells”.
